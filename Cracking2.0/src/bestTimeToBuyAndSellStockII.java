/* Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price 
 * of a given stock on day i. Design an algorithm to find the 
 * maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as 
 * you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times). 
 * However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at 
 * the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again). */

/* Got ideas from online:
 * Use greedy algorithm for this problem, always seek for the local max number,
 * the number that is right next to the max is smaller than the max number while
 * all the numbers that are before this max are smaller than the max, we call this number
 * local max and sell the stock at this price, initially, we buy the stock at the lowest
 * price, indicated by the startIndex. 
 * On the way of calculating local max profit one by one, we add them up to the totalProfit. */
