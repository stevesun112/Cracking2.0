/* Cracking 9.2:
 * This problem is also from 加州鬼混 Day 9:
 * Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner 
 * of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in 
 * two directions: right and down. 
 * How many possible paths are there for the robot 
 * go from (0, 0) to (X, Y)? 
 * */

/*This is actually a very easy problem:
 * we name path(x, y) as a method to return how many
 * possible paths there are from (0, 0) to arrive at 
 * (x, y), then it's just to find out its recursion formula.
 * It turned out to be there are only two possible ways:
 * it either comes from the top or from the left, so it either comes from (x-1, y)
 * or from (x, y-1).
 * 
 * So, the possible ways to arrive at (x, y) is these two possibilities combined.
 * Then we get path(x, y) = path(x-1, y) + path(x, y-1).
 * This is just our recursion formula for this problem.
 * 
 * Now we need to figure out when is the terminating condition, noticing that if 
 * either side (x or y) reaches to the edge (the topmost line or the leftmost line),
 * then there's no other possible ways to go but only one way (because it can only go in two directions).
 * So, our terminating condition is that either x == 0 or y == 0, then this program is out! */
