/* Cracking 7.3:
 * Given two lines on a Cartesian plane, determine whether the two lines would intersect. */

/* As the Cracking solution suggests, there'are lots of ambiguities in this problem that we should ask
 * the interviewer:
 * 1. If two lines are the same (same slope and y-intercept), are they considered intersect?
 * 2. Then we need to decide which data structures to use. */


/* I did an awesome job in solving this problem! It's a very fruitful, happy and little struggling process. 
 * 
 * I decided to create my own class line, then in defining its constructors, I encountered difficulties in how 
 * to represent a dot (point) in the grid with two coordinates, a two-dimensional array is not a good choice, actually
 * it's not a right data structure at all to apply here, b/c 2-d array only means that it has two indices, but the value
 * contained in this array is just one value per element!
 * Then I quickly decided to create another class called point! 
 * 
 * I really enjoy this feeling! 
 * 
 * After debugging, I realized that I need to consider the situation when the line has a slope of zero which is
 * undefined in Java as the denominator cannot be zero in common sense, then I decided to assign it to zero manually
 * to deal with this exception! Cool! I made it in less than 15 mins! */
