/* Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
	Note:
	Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. 
	Could you implement it without using extra memory?

/* Initially I thought of using HashMap to implement, as some people tried over the Internet, but it didn't
 * work out, or at least I didn't make it run, then I googled it and found this incredibly concise and simple
 * algorithm, just use exclusive OR to traverse this array! */

/* The reason we can do this is that, a number XOR with itself will end up in zero,
 * so as long as the number appears twice, it will set the result to zero;
 * and also any number XOR with zero will return itself, so, we can get this unique number by
 * directly returning the result of XOR. */
