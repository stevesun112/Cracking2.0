/* Cracking 5.8:
 * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight
 * consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where
 * w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height
 * of the screen , of course, can be derived from the length of the array and
 * the width.
 * Implement a function
 * drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)
 * which draws a horizontal line from (x1, y) to (x2, y).*/


/* I wrote my own algorithm which is very straightforward, the Cracking solution
 * uses a more efficient way to deal with this problem. */

	/*Some explanation for byte, this primitive data type in Java:
	 * byte: The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer. 
	 * It has a minimum value of -128 and a maximum value of 127 (inclusive). 
	 * The byte data type can be useful for saving memory in large arrays, 
	 * where the memory savings actually matters. They can also be used in place
	 * of int where their limits help to clarify your code; 
	 * the fact that a variable's range is limited can serve as a form of documentation.*/
