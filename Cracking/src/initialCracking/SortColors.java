import java.util.HashMap;

/* Leetcode:
 * 
 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same 
 * color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue. 
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue 
 * respectively. 
 * Note: You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem. */


/* Suppose this problem doesn't require to sort them in a stable way, if it requires, I'll have to set
 * the values of the HashMap to be an ArrayList. 
 * Hooray, it accepts! No need to sort them in a stable way! And even no need to use HashMap! */

/* But DO keep in mind that I shouldn't use print statements, otherwise OJ will always report internal
 * errors! */

/* I finished this job all by myself, pretty soon, hooray! */
