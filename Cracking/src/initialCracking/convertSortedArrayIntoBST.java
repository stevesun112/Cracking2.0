/* I knew this is a recursive problem and I was half way there, but I just didn't think it out all by myself
 * and I didn't think of writing a help function either, so I basically copied the algorithm from online and
 * made it accepted on Leetcode. */

/* Keep this lesson in mind: the usual and very handy way to deal with the situation when each time
 * you want to call a function and it returns a new result, at the same time, you want to modify the new
 * result when you call this function again, the best way is to create a help function which takes this
 * constantly changing result as a parameter!!! Make it a parameter of the help function, this is the most
 * handy way to implement this function!!! Cool! This is especially useful when dealing with recursive functions!*/
