/* Leetcode: 
 * Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', 
 * return the length of last word in the string.
 * If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

For example, 
Given s = "Hello World",
return 5.*/


/* Algorithm: start from the end of the string, begin counting when it meets the first
 * alphabet, when it meets the first non-alphabet stuff, it exits and return the counter. 
 * 
 * Here, the tricky part is how to jump out of the loop when it has started counting and
 * encountered the first non-alphabet stuff, I Googled it and found people use 
 * two while loops
 * , this is a very handy algorithm! 
 * 
 * Also, you need to pay attention to the array boundary problem, it took me quite a while
 * to make it accepted on Leetcode. */
