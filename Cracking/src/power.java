/* Leetcode: Implement pow(x, n).
 * 
 * I wrote mine at first, but it didn't work out, because I failed to take into account of
 * the situation when n is negative. But when I tried to consider this scenario, I didn't come
 * up with a possible solution. 
 * 
 * So I got the following algorithm online. 
 * 
 * Recursion is more efficient than iteration, also it uses loop unrolling by a factor of two,
 * this also significantly increases the efficiency. */

		double temp = pow(x, Math.abs(n/2));
		if(n > 0){
			if(n%2 != 0)/* if n is odd, we need to multiply x one more time b/c the division in
			Java truncates the remainder. */{
				//System.out.println(temp);
