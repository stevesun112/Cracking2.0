/* Cracking 5.4:
 * Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible
 * (e.g. bit 0 and bit 1 are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on. */

/* I figured this algorithm out all by myself! Cool! */

/* My algorithm:
 * First left shit one bit to get all the odd bits are correct, then we AND this number with 10101010
 * to clear all the even bits, (i.e. to set all the even bits to zero);
 * Second, right shit one bit to get all the even bits are correct, then we AND this number with 01010101
 * to clear all the odd bits, (i.e. to set all the odd bits to zero);
 * Finally, we OR these two numbers to get the final result! */
