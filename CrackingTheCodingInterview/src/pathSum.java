/* Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree 
 * has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values 
 * along the path equals the given sum.

For example:
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22. */

/* I copied this code from Chris Huang. This is a very smart algorithm.
 * 
 * Keep in mind that for RECURSIVE functions, it always pushes the most recent function
 * into stack, and then execute the next one, when reaching the base condition, it will finish
 * the current function and begin executing all the previously pushed-into-the-stack functions
 * one after another until the stack is empty!
 * 
 * This is the core essence of all RECURSIVE functions! Keep it in mind.
 * 
 * Then no wonder why when it reaches hasPathSum(null, -5), it executes return false;
 * and after this, it didnt quit the function and end in there, instead, it keeps executing all the
 * previously executed functions until it meets the condition or traversed the whole tree. */
