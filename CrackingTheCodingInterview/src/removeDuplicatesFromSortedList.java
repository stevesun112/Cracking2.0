/* My code didn't work out, although 50% of them is correct, then I copied Chris Huang's
 * code, and it got accepted!
 * 
 * Now I have a better understanding of LinkedList node:
 * I originally wrote
 * ListNode cur = new ListNode(head.val);
 * but this is wrong, this means I created a new node of type ListNode called cur,
 * and its val, (only its val) is equal to head.val, but cur and head are two different things,
 * however, Chris wrote like this:
 * ListNode cur;
 * cur = head;
 * this is totally different from mine, in his first statement, he simply declares a variable called
 * cur of type ListNode, and in his second statement, he assigns the entire head to cur, he's using
 * the original ListNode (and the original whole linkedlist), but my code was not. 
 * 
 * Keep this lesson in mind! */
