/* Assume that the application is given two arbitrary 
 * string lists one of which is designated as the 
 * Source and the other as the Prefixes. The application 
 * will produce a merged list containing items that come 
 * from the Source and Prefixes lists. The string lists 
 * contain 7-bit nonzero ASCII characters and are sorted 
 * using a standard case-insensitive ASCII string comparison 
 * test with strings that are less than other strings by the 
 * comparison coming first in the list. It can also be assumed 
 * that no two strings in a given list are identical under 
 * this comparison. An item X is in the merged list if and 
 * only if one of the following is true. */

 * Prefixes list: ein, ab, ge, ver, gegen, st, nein
 * Mergest list: einmachen, abholen, gestellen, ver, gegen, st, nein */
