/* Very fruitful, I just made a few small modifications to the previous program, then amazingly, it
 * got accepted on Leetcode! 
 * 
 * First, I changed the counters j to start from i + 1
 * 								and k to start from j + 1;
 * and set both j and k less than len, this is sufficient, if I set j less than len - 1
 * and k less than len - 2, than these three pointers won't traverse thru the whole array.
 * 
 * Then I added this truncating code:
 * 
 * if(sum == target){
						return sum;
					}
					
	This fragment of code breaks the program from executing as soon as the sum of three elements
	equals the target, this way, it actually saves lots time to traverse thru the rest of the array
	which is meaningless, surprisingly, after this, it got accepted!
	
	Praise the Lord!*/

/* Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that

    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2). */
